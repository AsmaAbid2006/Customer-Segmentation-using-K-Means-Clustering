# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
This is a detailed and explained code which trains a machine learning model for customer segmentation on basis of various factors for targeted marketing.
This code uses K-Means clustering to make clusters on basis of different factors like high income-high expenditure, low income-high expenditure, high income-low expenditure and low income-low expenditure.
This is applied practically for targeted marketing.
I downloaded a .csv file for dataset which is attatched in the repository.
All you need to is add the path of the .csv file in the repository.
Every step is explained in the code in he form of comments and the model's efficiency is visualized at the end using matplotlib.
